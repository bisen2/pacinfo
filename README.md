# pacinfo

Simple program to display package info on systems using pacman

## Bash Implementation
This is just a very basic bash script to display number of packages in each category.

## C Implementation
A program written in C to display number of packages in each category. I hope to also implement the ability to see what packages are in each category and potentially delete them.
### Note: This implementation is not complete and is still under development
